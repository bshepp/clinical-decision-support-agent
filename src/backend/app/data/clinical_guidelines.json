Initiation: typically when in mild-moderate withdrawal (COWS ≥8-12). Standard dose: 8-24 mg/day sublingual. Methadone: full agonist, requires OTP (opioid treatment program). Standard dose: 60-120 mg/day. Naltrexone (extended-release injection, Vivitrol): opioid antagonist, 380mg IM monthly — requires 7-14 days opioid-free before initiation. All three reduce opioid use, overdose, and mortality. Combine with psychosocial support. Alcohol use disorder (AUD): Naltrexone 50mg PO daily or 380mg IM monthly (reduces heavy drinking, craving). Acamprosate 666mg TID (supports abstinence). Disulfiram 250mg daily (aversion therapy). Alcohol withdrawal: CIWA protocol — benzodiazepines (chlordiazepoxide, lorazepam, diazepam) titrated to symptom severity. Severe withdrawal/delirium tremens: ICU-level care, IV benzodiazepines, consider phenobarbital adjunct. Wernicke encephalopathy: IV thiamine 500mg TID x 3-5 days BEFORE glucose."

If <4 METs or unknown: will further testing change management? If surgery-specific risk is elevated and stress testing will change management, consider pharmacologic stress testing. Continue beta-blockers if already on them. Do NOT start beta-blockers on the day of surgery. Continue statins perioperatively.

    "text": "Hyperkalemia: Mild (5.0-5.9 mEq/L), Moderate (6.0-6.4), Severe (≥6.5 or any level with ECG changes). ECG changes progression: peaked T waves → prolonged PR → loss of P waves → widened QRS → sine wave → VF/asystole. Immediate management for severe/symptomatic: (1) Cardiac membrane stabilization: Calcium gluconate 10% 10-20 mL IV over 2-3 minutes (or calcium chloride via central line) — onset 1-3 min, duration 30-60 min, repeat in 5 min if ECG unchanged. (2) Transcellular shift: Regular insulin 10 units IV + dextrose 25g IV (D50 50mL) — onset 15-30 min, duration 4-6 hours. Albuterol 10-20mg nebulized — onset 15-30 min. Sodium bicarbonate 50 mEq IV — mainly if acidotic, less effective alone. (3) Potassium removal: Sodium polystyrene sulfonate (Kayexalate) — limited/slow effect, use with caution. Patiromer or sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (Lokelma) — newer K+ binders, better tolerated. Loop diuretics (furosemide 40-80mg IV) if adequate renal function. Hemodialysis: definitive treatment for severe/refractory hyperkalemia, especially in ESRD or AKI. Continuous telemetry until K+ corrected. Identify and treat underlying cause (medications — ACEi, ARBs, K+-sparing diuretics, NSAIDs, TMP-SMX; renal failure; tissue destruction; acidosis)."

    "text": "Acute appendicitis: Alvarado score (MANTRELS: Migration, Anorexia, Nausea, Tenderness RLQ, Rebound, Elevated temp, Leukocytosis, Shift to left). CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast (sensitivity >98%) for diagnosis. Uncomplicated appendicitis: laparoscopic appendectomy (standard of care) or antibiotic trial in select cases (amoxicillin-clavulanate or ciprofloxacin + metronidazole). Complicated (perforated/abscess): antibiotics ± percutaneous drainage if large abscess; interval appendectomy in 6-8 weeks vs. early appendectomy based on clinical scenario. Acute cholecystitis: RUQ pain, positive Murphy's sign, fever, elevated WBC. Ultrasound: gallbladder wall thickening >4mm, pericholecystic fluid, sonographic Murphy's sign. Tokyo Guidelines severity grading. Grade I (mild): early laparoscopic cholecystectomy (within 72 hours preferred). Grade II (moderate, WBC >18K, palpable mass, duration >72h): early surgery if tolerated, or percutaneous cholecystostomy if poor surgical candidate. Grade III (severe, organ dysfunction): stabilize + cholecystostomy. Antibiotics: ceftriaxone + metronidazole or piperacillin-tazobactam. Small bowel obstruction (SBO): NPO + NGT decompression + IV fluids. CT with IV and oral contrast to assess partial vs complete, strangulation signs (mesenteric haziness, absent bowel wall enhancement). Partial SBO: conservative trial 48-72 hours with Gastrografin challenge. Complete/strangulated SBO: urgent surgical exploration."

    "text": "Hypercalcemia: Mild (10.5-11.9 mg/dL), Moderate (12.0-13.9), Severe (≥14.0 or symptomatic). Most common causes: primary hyperparathyroidism (outpatient) and malignancy (inpatient). Symptoms: stones, bones, groans, psychiatric moans (nephrolithiasis, bone pain, abdominal pain/constipation/nausea, confusion/depression). Acute management of hypercalcemic crisis (Ca >14 or symptomatic): (1) Aggressive IV hydration — NS 200-500 mL/hr initially (adjust for cardiac/renal function). (2) Calcitonin 4 IU/kg IM/subQ every 12 hours (rapid onset but tachyphylaxis in 48 hours). (3) IV bisphosphonate — zoledronic acid 4mg IV over 15 minutes (onset 2-4 days, duration 2-4 weeks) or pamidronate 60-90mg IV over 2-4 hours. (4) Denosumab for bisphosphonate-refractory cases. (5) Glucocorticoids for granulomatous disease or lymphoma-related hypercalcemia. Avoid loop diuretics unless volume overloaded. Primary hyperparathyroidism: Parathyroidectomy is definitive treatment. Surgical indications (asymptomatic PHPT): age <50, Ca >1 mg/dL above ULN, T-score <-2.5, vertebral fracture, CrCl <60, 24h urine calcium >400 mg, nephrolithiasis/nephrocalcinosis. Calcimimetics (cinacalcet) for patients who decline/cannot undergo surgery. Monitor those managed non-surgically with annual serum calcium, BMD every 1-2 years, renal function."

    "text": "Aortic dissection: Stanford Type A (involves ascending aorta — surgical emergency) and Type B (descending aorta only — typically medical management). Clinical presentation: sudden-onset severe tearing/ripping chest or back pain, often radiating. May present with pulse/BP differential between arms, aortic regurgitation murmur, stroke symptoms, malperfusion syndrome (mesenteric, renal, limb ischemia). Diagnostic workup: D-dimer negative has high negative predictive value in low-risk patients. CT angiography (CTA) of entire aorta is gold standard (sensitivity >98%). TEE for hemodynamically unstable patients unable to transport to CT. Immediate management: Pain control (IV morphine/fentanyl), anti-impulse therapy — target HR <60 and SBP 100-120 mmHg. First-line: IV esmolol (500 mcg/kg bolus then 50-200 mcg/kg/min) or IV labetalol 20mg bolus then 1-2 mg/min infusion. If BP remains elevated: add IV nicardipine or nitroprusside (only after adequate beta-blockade). Type A dissection: emergent surgical repair (mortality increases 1-2% per hour of delay). Type B uncomplicated: medical management, serial imaging. Type B complicated (malperfusion, rapid expansion, rupture): urgent TEVAR (thoracic endovascular aortic repair). Long-term: lifelong antihypertensive therapy, serial aortic imaging (CTA or MRA at 1, 3, 6, 12 months then annually)."
